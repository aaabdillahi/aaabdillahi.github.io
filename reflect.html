          <h3> Concept of Responsive design </h3>
          <p>Approach to web design for making web pages render well on a variety of devices.

Responsive web design is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.

Responsive layouts automatically adjust and adapt to any device screen size, whether it is a desktop, a laptop, a tablet, or a mobile phone.

Responsive web design has become more important as the amount of mobile traffic now accounts for more than half of total internet traffic.

"Mobile first", unobtrusive JavaScript, and progressive enhancement are related concepts that predate RWD. Browsers of basic mobile phones do not understand JavaScript or media queries, so a recommended practice is to create a basic web site and enhance it for smart phones and Personal Computers, rather than rely on graceful degradation to make a complex, image-heavy site work on mobile phones.

Where a web site must support basic mobile devices that lack JavaScript, browser detection and mobile device detection are two ways of deducing if certain HTML and CSS features are supported-however, these methods are not completely reliable unless used in conjunction with a device capabilities database.

Luke Wroblewski has summarized some of the RWD and mobile design challenges, and created a catalog of multi-device layout patterns.

Responsive design was listed as #2 in Top Web Design Trends for 2012 by.net magazine after progressive enhancement at #1. Mashable called 2013 the Year of Responsive Web Design.

Many other sources have recommended responsive design as a cost-effective alternative to mobile applications due to its ability to house all of the code in a single website.

                "The control which designers know in the print medium, and often desire in the web medium, is simply a function of the limitation of the printed page. We should embrace the fact that the web doesn’t have the same constraints, and design for this flexibility. But first, we must 'accept the ebb and flow of things." A List Apart, 25 May, 2010,

            <h3> Techniques, Technologies, and Patterns </h3>
            <p>
               Using this line will allow our browsers to control the page's dimensions and scaling <br>
               <b>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</b><br><br>
               In the CSS file, we used a <b>@media</b>query. Within in we set the <b>(max-width: 620px)</b>. <br>
               This means that if a device with a width of less than 620px, it will be rendered as mobile device format.<br>
               It will be rendered to mobile by using this line within your CSS file <b>(width: 100%)</b> This will tell the viewport
               that the width will be 100% when the size is 620px or smaller.<br>
